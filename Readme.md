Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for a line-following robot project. The robot uses sensor data to follow a predefined path marked by a line on the ground. This project aims to demonstrate basic principles of robotics, sensor integration, and control systems.

Features
Line Detection: Uses IR sensors to detect the line on the ground.
Path Following: Implements PID control to follow the line accurately.
Obstacle Avoidance: (Optional) Integrates additional sensors to detect and avoid obstacles.
Adjustable Parameters: Allows tuning of PID coefficients for optimal performance.
Components
Microcontroller: Arduino, Raspberry Pi, or any compatible microcontroller.
Sensors: Infrared (IR) sensors or reflectance sensors.
Actuators: DC motors or servos.
Power Supply: Battery pack or other power sources.
Chassis: A basic robot chassis with mounting hardware.
Installation
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/line-following-robot.git
Install Dependencies

For Arduino:

Open the Arduino IDE.
Go to Sketch > Include Library > Add .ZIP Library.
Select the libraries folder included in this repository.
For Raspberry Pi:

Ensure you have Python 3 installed.

Install required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Upload Code to Microcontroller

For Arduino:

Open line_following_robot.ino in the Arduino IDE.
Select your board and port from the Tools menu.
Upload the code to your Arduino.
For Raspberry Pi:

Run the Python script:

bash
Copy code
python line_following_robot.py
Connect Components

Connect IR sensors to the designated pins on the microcontroller.
Connect DC motors or servos to the motor driver.
Calibrate Sensors

Follow the calibration instructions in the code comments or documentation to ensure accurate line detection.
Run the Robot

Place the robot on a track with a visible line and power it on.
The robot should start following the line autonomously.
